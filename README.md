> **Pronunciation:** /ˈpuːliʃ/
>
> _Poolish_ is a highly fluid yeast-cultured dough used in the baking industry as a pre-ferment. Its purpose is to enhance the development of flavours and improve the structural integrity of bread and related baked goods. The composition of poolish typically includes equal weights of flour and water, combined with a small amount of yeast. This mixture is allowed to ferment over a period of time before being incorporated into the final dough mixture.
